He also holds a position as a consultant to the Palacký University Olomouc, Czech Republic. Dr Templ is a researcher at the Quality and Methods Unit at Statistics Austria. His other consultation works include for the World Bank and the OECD. His main research interest is in the area of imputation, statistical disclosure control, visualization, compositional data analysis, computational statistics, teaching in statistics and cluster analysis. He participated in many European research projects, to name one of those: the AMELI project for adequate estimation of poverty and social exclusion. Dr Templ has more than 280 scientific contributions in books, scientific journals and conferences as well as more than 40 papers in well-known indexed scientific journals.  He is the author and maintainer of several R packages for official statistics, such as the `sdcMicro` package for statistical disclosure control, the `VIM` package for visualization and imputation of missing values, the `simPop` package for synthetic population simulation, and the `robCompositions` package for robust analysis of compositional data. He is also a co-author to many other packages.  In addition, Dr. Matthias Templ is the editor-in-chief of the Austrian Journal of Statistics; associate editor for Springer’s Journal Wirtschafts-und Sozialstatistische Archiv; editor for the journal The Register; and on the editorial board of three other journals – JWARP journal, The Journal Transactions on Data Privacy, and the Journal Frontiers in Biomedical Physics |
